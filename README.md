## 'Survey Web'

#### Viedeo Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyCNUgh1pdI
#### Description: 

I created a responsive website that enables you to carry out survey

In the website, it has a nav bar of **Instagram** **Facebook**, **YouTube**, **Products**, and **Survey**.
If you click **Instagram** or ""Facebook"", it redirects you to my actual Instagram/Facebook account (You are welcome to follow!)
If you click **You tube**, it automatically links you to my YouTube channel where I upload my songs which are recorded I went to Karaoke(I'm an excellent singer ;) )
IF you click **Products**, you won't see anything because this page is for admin.
By clicking **Survey**, you can do survey but you have to log in first. If you log in, you will see questions and by choosing the question you will be redirected to the page that you can actually vote.

To register, your id has to be unique, and you have to submit your email address and password twice which is for confirmation purpose.
The password automatically hashed out so no need to worry about security.(Django API)

In the index page, I made the page responsive.
When you resize the page size, the images will crop out automatically keeping the images still centered. 

Down below, you will see more my pictures and my contact as well.
Feel free to contact me if you want to talk to me.

Thank you!
