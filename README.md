## 'Survey Web'

#### Viedeo Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyCNUgh1pdI
#### Description: 

I created a responsive website that enables you to carry out survey

In the website, it has a nav bar of **Instagram** **Facebook**, **YouTube**, **Products**, and **Survey**.
If you click **Instagram** or ""Facebook"", it redirects you to my actual Instagram/Facebook account (You are welcome to follow!)
If you click **You tube**, it automatically links you to my YouTube channel where I upload my songs which are recorded I went to Karaoke(I'm an excellent singer ;) )
IF you click **Products**, you won't see anything because this page is for admin.
By clicking **Survey**, you can do survey but you have to log in first. If you log in, you will see questions and by choosing the question you will be redirected to the page that you can actually vote.

To register, you are to submit your id, your email address and password twice for confirmation purpose.(Django API of UserCreationForm)
If any of those is submitted wrong, it will show an error message describing which part was handled wrong.
The password will automatically be hashed out so no need to worry about security.(Django User API)

In the index page, I made the page responsive.
When you resize the page size, the images will crop out automatically keeping the images still centered.
I did not want my pictures to expand when the device width shrinks. Instead, I wanted it to cut out the outer side. So I prepared a picture that is super wide and height of 512pxs for a mornitor whose width is really wide(My mornitor is 32 inches). I had to crop out my original pictures and had to make sure its height to width proportion is 1 to 4. At the same time I wanted to show the pictures I took so I had to look through my photos checking if it has 1 to 4 proportion.

Down below, you will see more my pictures and my contact as well.
Feel free to contact me if you want to talk to me.

Overall, I used python and Django framework and followed the Django tutorial and then made it tailored so that I can use it as web application.
I did a lot of research just to make this web application. And I will keep on developing this website so that I can actually use it on my own.
To manage data, I used Sqlite3 using Django models.py. Through Django model, I was able to control the data form more efficiently.
For styling the website, I used bootstrap and Carousel example. And thanks to this project, I was able to learn how to use bootstrap properly.

I did lots of google research to solve all the little problems and became confident in fixing problems.
Doing research, I tried my best not to move on to next step, but to **learn** what is going on and how to apply the technique so that I can improve myself as a programmer.

Thank you!
